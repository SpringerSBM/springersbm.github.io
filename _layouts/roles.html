			<h2>
				Hello. We’re Springer IT.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Springer is a world-class international publisher. With over eight million content items available online to academic and professional institutions globally, our digital-first strategy embraces the modern economy.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are a multi-disciplinary team working in a fast-paced and collaborative environment, who value honest opinion and open debate. We’re responsible for designing, building, testing and releasing our new content distribution site, <a href="http://link.springer.com">SpringerLink</a>, as well as integrating all Springer’s key online offerings into one platform. We’re in the business of building enterprise-class web applications, and delivering a first-rate user experience is essential.

			<h2>Working here</h2>
			<p>
				We build our software incrementally, iteratively, and continuously, so you’ll be able to see new work go live to over four million visitors around the globe every week. XP and Kanban heavily influence our flavour of agile and if something isn’t working, we change it.
			</p>
			<p>		
				So that our work delivers value to both the business and our customers, our teams are cross-discipline: business analysts and the user experience team work with stakeholders to coordinate research and understand requirements, whilst our frontend developers and software engineers pair with quality analysts to develop the most robust solutions, and our platform engineers work across the organisation to ensure our infrastructure never lets us down.
			</p>	
			<p>This role is based in our office in {{page.office}}.</p>
