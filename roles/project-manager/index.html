      <h2>Working here</h2>
      <p>
        We build our software incrementally, iteratively, and continuously, so you’ll be able to see new work go live to over four million visitors around the globe every week. XP and Kanban heavily influence our flavour of agile and if something isn’t working, we change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our teams are cross-discipline so that our work delivers value to both the business and our customers: business analysts and UX designers work with stakeholders to coordinate research and understand requirements, frontend developers and software engineers pair with quality analysts to develop the most robust solutions, and our platform engineers work across the organisation to ensure our infrastructure never lets us down.
      </p>
      <p>This role is based in our office in {{page.office}}.</p>
