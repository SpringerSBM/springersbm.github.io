##About our team

Like our main platform, our team has been built from the ground up. Right from the start we've been committed to hiring the best people we can get and cultivating an energetic, start-up style culture. 

###Our Technology

We’re passionate about our technology choices, but we’re not dogmatic. We let the team lead our decisions. 

We develop on **Linux** and we have **Macbooks**. Our primary language is **Scala**. It felt like an edgy choice to begin with, but we’ve never looked back. Working with us is a great opportunity for anyone with a strong Java background to learn it. 

Databases are important. Publishing runs on **XML**, and the **MarkLogic** database is at the heart of our products. But we also have projects running on **Cassandra**, Mongo and Couch DB. Not to mention **MySQL**. 

Our UX guys care deeply about what they do. We use **SASS** and **CoffeeScript** to realise their dreams, and our designs are always responsive. 

We’re all about **continuous delivery**. If it needs doing more than once, we automate it. We find that a little **Ruby** goes a long way and employ tools like **Chef** and **Capistrano** to configure and deploy. Our source is **Git**, of course. 


###Our Values

We’re firm believers in the virtues of **agile** development, we’ve never worked any other way. We run a kanban based process with short iterations and deploy to live every week. We write **user stories** in a BDD style. We use **TDD** and encourage pair programming. Our walls are covered in index cards and whiteboards. And **if something isn’t working, we change it**. 

Our working environment is **informal, lively and democratic**. We value everyone’s opinion and enjoy a healthy debate. There’s no standing on ceremony. 

Much as we enjoy our work, we understand the importance of having **fun**. We have a well stocked snack cupboard and spend plenty of time in the local pubs. We have a keenly competitive football table, and some rather less competitive actual football. We’ve bowled, picnicked, and sung karaoke (Ed: Please remember you are trying to attract people). We’ve even been on a team trip to Madrid.
