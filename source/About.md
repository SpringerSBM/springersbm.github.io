##About our company

Springer SBM is one of the world's largest scientific, technical and medical publishers, and as the parent of [BiomedCentral](http://www.biomedcentral.com) we're also the world's largest Open Access publisher. We provide scientists and researchers with the information they need to drive forward the boundaries of human knowledge. We've been in business since 1842, but that doesn't mean we're stuck in the past. This is a digital industry which moves as fast as the pace of science itself.

We're a truly global organisation with offices around the world, but our main bases for technology development are in London, Berlin, and Pune. Our business is publishing, but our means is technology, and we've making major investments in our products and our people. Our main platform is [SpringerLink](http://link.springer.com), built in London as a greenfield project. But there's so much more to do. A shortage of ideas is not one of our problems.
